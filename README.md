# ActiveLearn
## ActiveLearn brings interactivity to online classes.
Over the last year, everyone has learned to communicate over video conferencing systems. These systems were not built for education.
We want to augment these systems with something that enhances student-teacher engagement on any web conferencing system.

## How we do it
We provide real-time data and feedback for teachers.
We help teachers create, share, and engage with their students with interactive documents:
* Document sharing
  * High resolution screen sharing system
  * Teacher can control pace of lesson
* Participants List
  * Teachers can see who is present in class
* Live quizzes
  * Gives teachers a better understanding of studentâ€™s current level
* Collaborative Notes
  * Provides the class the ability to work together alongside the teacher to grasp and enhance their knowledge
* User-Friendly UI
  * Quick setup
